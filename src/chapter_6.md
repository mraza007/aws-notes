- Its an elastic service that allows you to launch compute resources on the AWS cloud. In AWS context we call EC2 instances but you can think of them as virual machines.

- Each instance has an operating system,storage and virtual hard drive.

- When launching instances you can choose from `AWS MarketPlace` and 
`Community AMIs`.

- You can connect to EC2 instances using `ssh`.
